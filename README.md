# MovieQuizApp
This is a fun Android app. It was first thought of in XML code and later added Java functionality. The app contains 6 questions, including check boxes, radio buttons, and one text entry. It includes a button for the user to submit their answers and receive a score via a toast which accurately displays the results of the quiz and a reset button.
